# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using the Our World in Data (OWID) dataset. It includes interactive visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the global impact of the pandemic, track key metrics, and identify patterns across different countries and regions.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze global COVID-19 trends and patterns
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across different countries
- Visualize key indicators such as:
  - Daily new cases and deaths
  - Vaccination rates
  - Testing statistics
  - Hospitalization data
- Identify correlations between different COVID-19 metrics
- Create interactive dashboards for data exploration
